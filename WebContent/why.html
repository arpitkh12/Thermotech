    Thermocol is one of the forms of polystyrene that is widely used as a plastic product. It turns into a flowing state when heated above 100 degree C and solidifies again when cooled down, which helps in easy molding of this material into different shapes. Thermocol Sheets are used for packaging of delicate items as they are shock absorbent and break the fall of the item delicately. Thermocol cups and plates are used for serving food as they can be disposed easily afterwards. But are these the only characteristics making it popular? Here are some reasons as to why thermocol is a great material.<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Packaging</b>: One of the major use for thermocol is in the packaging industry. Thermocol is extremely lightweight and very easy to carry. But it also has a cushioning property to provide protection to the items in case of accidents or falls. Its shock absorption property acts up if there is any kind of major impact from any side. Thermocol Sheet Manufacturers in Noida provide packaging sheets that can be molded or changed into different sizes and shapes according to the requirements of different products.<br>

      </li>
      <li> <b>Thermal Efficiency</b>: Thermocol Sheets have an efficient thermal capacity. They can easily retain the thermal conditions of the item they cover. Thermocol cups and glasses are popular because of their ability to keep food items hot/cold and fresh. Thermocol boxes can act as ice boxes because they can keep the ice from melting.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li> <b>Recyclable</b>: Thermocol is a polystyrene which can be recycled to form new compounds. Recycled thermocol can be mixed with concrete to produce new and stronger building products. They are also used for making egg cartons and even sandwich holders.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li> <b>Moisture penetration</b>: It acts a natural defense against moisture. Thermocol is effective to prevent water or moisture from seeping in and harming the product in any way.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    All these reasons make thermocol popular for packaging and foodservice industry. Thermocol Sheets can be used for packaging of delicate items like crockery, glass items, electronics etc.&nbsp;
